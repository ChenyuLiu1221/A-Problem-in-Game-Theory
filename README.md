# Formulation of the Problem
There are two integers x and y ranging from 1 to 30. Suppose Alice knows the sum of these two integers while Bob knows the product of them. 
Bob says: "I have no idea of the numbers." Alice then says: "I cannot determine them as well." 
"I get the answer!", Bob immediately follows. "I get it too!"Alice also cracks the problem. 
Question: what are the numbers given to Alice and Bob. (Suppose x and y could be the same number)
